TWDB is responsible for putting together the first statewide flood plan for Texas. Because flooding is unique to the watershed, TWDB coordinated flood planning at the regional level. Each region worked independently with their chosen engineering firm to develop flood models.

In order to pull together the regional work into a statewide plan, TWDB is collecting the flood models from each region. Flood model files are often too large to be uploaded through a browser, and they do not follow a standard file structure. 

As a result, TDIS developed a four part application. These parts include:

* Metadata configuration. First, the user sets up the model metadata through a web form.
* Data upload. Next, the user receives instructions covering how to prepare their model files and upload them through the terminal.
* Data validation. Once the files have been uploaded, the TDIS system checks the upload for completeness.
* Data management. After validation, the data is available for review in the MS2 web portal.`},{Operational:"Yes",Type:"Service",SubType:"Model",Acronym:"MEEP",Name:"Model Evaluation and Execution Platform",Audience:"USACE Reviewers, RBFS Vendors",Host_Location:"Microsoft Azure",Dev_URL:null,URL:null,Github_Repo:null,Abstract:null,Description:"TDIS personnel have developed and presented a workflow to allow USACE to do their model review on TDIS-deployed cloud based Virtual Machines"},{Operational:null,Type:"Service",SubType:null,Acronym:"DIS",Name:"Data Ingest Service",Audience:"RBFS Vendors",Host_Location:"TACC",Dev_URL:null,URL:null,Github_Repo:null,Abstract:null,Description:null},{Operational:null,Type:"Service",SubType:null,Acronym:"ACT-FAST",Name:"Advanced compound flood hazard assessment science for TDIS",Audience:`TIFF via USACE, Galveston Office, WRM Modelers

TDIS has developed a metadata standard that sets out the metadata fields we expect to collect for datasets, models, and other artifacts. This information is published via GitHub: https://github.com/TexasDIS/metadata We continue to make revisions to the metadata standard in consultation with the RBFS vendor teams and other partners. We provide training and guidance on metadata requirements and expectations to partners and have developed a provisional tool that walks users through our metadata standard in an accessible format intended for use by those with little training or expertise in metadata creation.

The new version includes additional data on distance to lakes and precipitation, and is able to predict flood risk in 207 watersheds across the entire state of Texas.
