TDIS is a stakeholder-driven, web-based spatial data services architecture designed to support decision making at the state level for a more resilient Texas.\r
\r
TDIS is funded by the Texas General Land Office Community Development and Revitalization(GLO-CDR) Contract 20-165-000-C238. The TDIS project is implemented with the goal of ensuring that the data and tools will be open source, accessible, and usable. The stakeholders and users of TDIS are engineers, analysts, planners, and decision makers at local, state, and federal agencies. The success of TDIS rests on delivering services and tools that our local, state, and federal stakeholders want and use.\r
\r
The mission of TDIS is to increase disaster resilience by addressing real-world problems through open, transparent, and accessible data products and services.\r
\r
TDIS strives to provide data services and decision support tools that:\r
* Are people and problem-centered\r
* Are decision- and action-minded\r
* Use trusted sources\r
* Are developed via team-based collaboration\r

# What problem does TDIS solve?\r
Right now, multiple federal, state, and local agencies are collecting and using data to respond and mitigate against the effects of numerous disaster events in Texas.  However, disaster information is often fragmented, poorly maintained, and difficult to access. This lack of data coherency limits the ability of responders, planners, grantmakers, and researchers to support disaster resilience. TDIS will address these challenges by:\r
\r
* Stewarding high-value disaster datasets by offering a standard catalog system and integrated access to discoverable data sources through a single mediated point (i.e., a federated information system).\r
* Employing data analytics, mapping technologies, and decision support tools to provide information needed to understand hazard risks, assess disaster impacts, and develop mitigation strategies.\r
* Enabling sharing of Texas-based disaster information and preserving data products generated during disaster response, recovery, and planning efforts with easy to use, consistent and secure APIs, applications and services.\r
\r
# What does TDIS do for Texans?/TDIS is for Texans\r
TDIS empowers Texans to use data to make decisions about their communities, such as: where to build to reduce disaster risk, how to prepare for multi-hazard situations, and what kinds of risks should we consider when planning for the future? \u2013 and much more.\r
\r
# What are the goals of TDIS?/Goals of TDIS\r
* Collect, create, and provide data, models, and analytical tools that support disaster resilience efforts for the state of Texas.\r
* Consolidate data and information spread across a large number of agencies and systems into one single disaster preparedness resource.\r
* Provide reliable and timely insights for a diverse group of stakeholders to make decisions during different stages of disasters.\r
* Use and transform data to better prepare Texans for and mitigate against disasters across the state.\r
\r
# How did TDIS come to be?/History\r
The Texas Disaster Information System (TDIS) started in 2020 with a year-long planning and ideation process. TDIS is envisioned initially as a ten-year effort. Phase 1 of TDIS development kicked off in February 2022. The TDIS plan is a communication tool to help stakeholders work together to accomplish\r
the mission of empowering decision makers with information. The plan is \u201Cevergreen,\u201D meaning it will be reviewed and revised at regular intervals over\r
the course of the TDIS lifecycle to adjust its content to best support the TDIS mission.\r
