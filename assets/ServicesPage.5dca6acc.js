TDIS has developed a metadata standard that sets out the metadata fields we expect to collect for datasets, models, and other artifacts. This information is published via GitHub: https://github.com/TexasDIS/metadata We continue to make revisions to the metadata standard in consultation with the RBFS vendor teams and other partners. We provide training and guidance on metadata requirements and expectations to partners and have developed a provisional tool that walks users through our metadata standard in an accessible format intended for use by those with little training or expertise in metadata creation.
